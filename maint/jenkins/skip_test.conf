# Contitional skip test settings
#
# Syntax (similar to a cron file):
#   [jobname] [compiler] [jenkins_configure] [netmod] [queue]
#   Note that the [jobname] allows partial matches (see examples). Other
#   conditions only allows exact matches.
#   The actual allowed combinations are depending on the Jenkins job. For
#   example,
#     mxm * * tcp *
#   will have no effect since none of the mxm jobs has tcp netmod in the
#   configuration.
#
# Examples:
#   mxm gnu debug * *
#   This will skip all tests when the job is "mpich-master-mxm" or
#   "mpich-review-mxm", the compiler is "gnu", and the jenkins_configure is
#   "debug".
#
#   master-ubuntu * * * ubuntu32 sed -i "..."
#   This will skip all test when the job is "mpich-master-ubuntu" and the
#   running queue is "ubuntu32".
